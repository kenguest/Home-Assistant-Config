# My Home Assistant Configuration
I'm maintaining this more as a way of reminding myself what hardware I'm using, and where I bought it.
(And also for reminding me what I'm planning to use other hardware for)

This all started off when we bought our new home and had a Hive system installed for controlling our heating.
I bought bought a light bulb, and power socket that could also be controlled with it, then I just kept adding to it.

The problem with Hive was/is that latency sucks - even with the plug and bulbs being locally controlled via the Hive Hub over a radio based protocol called
zigbee - communicating with the Hub via the Hive app on my phone required internet based comms to an AWS hosted server. Gotta hate it when servers go down...

Home Assistant is a much more local solution that doesn't require IoT comms, unless you want it to - and so I got hooked :-)

## Hardware ##
I'm running Home Assistant on a 4GB Raspberry PI 4 model B, with a 32 GB SD card, using a [Conbee II usb stick](https://phoscon.de/en/conbee2) for integrating/controlling Zigbee lights, plugs, and sensors.

Some of the plugs have power monitoring, and I've automations set up to send me messages when the dishwasher, washing machine and tumble dryer have finished. These are mostly gleaned from
Phil Hawthorne's excellent [Making ‚Äòdumb‚Äô Dishwashers and Washing Machines Smart: Alerts When the Dishes and Clothes Are Cleaned](https://philhawthorne.com/making-dumb-dishwashers-and-washing-machines-smart-alerts-when-the-dishes-and-clothes-are-cleaned/) article. He also wrote a great article on [managing your shopping list with Grocy and Home Assistant](https://philhawthorne.com/automating-your-shopping-list-with-home-assistant-and-grocy/).

These give continuous readings, so non-PIR based automations can factor in these readings |
