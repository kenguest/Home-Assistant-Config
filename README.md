# My Home Assistant Configuration
I'm maintaining this more as a way of reminding myself what hardware I'm using, and where I bought it.
(And also for reminding me what I'm planning to use other hardware for)

This all started off when we bought our new home and had a Hive system installed for controlling our heating.
I bought a light bulb, and power socket that could also be controlled with it, then I just kept adding to it.

The problem with Hive was/is that latency sucks - even with the plug and bulbs being locally controlled via the Hive Hub over a radio based protocol called
zigbee - communicating with the Hub via the Hive app on my phone required internet based comms to an AWS hosted server. Gotta hate it when servers go down...

Home Assistant is a much more local solution that doesn't require IoT comms, unless you want it to - and so I got hooked :-)

## Hardware ##
I'm running Home Assistant on a 4GB Raspberry PI 4 model B, with a 64 GB SD card, using a [Conbee II usb stick](https://phoscon.de/en/conbee2) for integrating/controlling Zigbee lights, plugs, and sensors.

Some of the plugs have power monitoring, and I've automations set up to send me messages when the dishwasher, washing machine and tumble dryer have finished. These are mostly gleaned from
Phil Hawthorne's excellent [Making ‚Äòdumb‚Äô Dishwashers and Washing Machines Smart: Alerts When the Dishes and Clothes Are Cleaned](https://philhawthorne.com/making-dumb-dishwashers-and-washing-machines-smart-alerts-when-the-dishes-and-clothes-are-cleaned/) article. He also wrote a great article on [managing your shopping list with Grocy and Home Assistant](https://philhawthorne.com/automating-your-shopping-list-with-home-assistant-and-grocy/).

Configure Onvif access through it's own app, and then access on port 8000 through Home Assistant. This got damaged and while it is still usable, I will be replacing it with a [Reolink doorbell](https://reolink.com/ie/product/reolink-video-doorbell-wifi/) which has better support in Home Assistant. |

## Software ##

### <a name="softwareintegrations"></a> Integrations ###
These are some of the integrations that I have set up for either day-to-day or occasional use.

#### [AVM Fritz!Box Tools](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/fritz/) ####
Used for presence detection, and for remotely rebooting/reconnecting the Internet connection.

#### [EventSensor](https://github.com/azogue/eventsensor) ####
Installed via HACS and used to make the Sonoff wireless switch events show as distinct/eaiser debugged in the Logbook -
[additional notes on using EventSensor here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/unable-to-pair-sonoff-zigbee-snzb-01-wb-01-buttons/218324/19), along with some on how to integrate natively. 


#### [Hive](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/hive/) ####
Used for controlling the Hive thermostats/heating. I can display when the water/heating was last on in Home Assistant, which is not possible in the native Hive app on my phone.

#### [HP Printer](https://github.com/elad-bar/ha-hpprinter) ####
Ink levels, and also number of pages printed and scanned.

#### [Garbage Collection](https://github.com/bruxy70/Garbage-Collection) ####
Sensor for notifications of scheduled collections, extremely configurable and
very hard to notice which is just what I need.

Just set up one entity for each separate type of collection (e.g. one for
compost day, and another for recycling if they're not collected on the same
day) and set the recurrence rules and icon/display accordingly.

#### [Met Eireann](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/met_eireann/) ####
Uses the Irish Meteorological Service weather forecast API to display weather
information in Home Assistant.

#### [Workday](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/workday/) ####
I'm using the Workday binary sensor integration so that work related
automations only get triggered on days that I'm supposed to be working on -
e.g. standard work week with Bank Holidays taken into consideration.
This means that monitors don't get turned on automatically on weekends or any
other day when I shouldn't need them.

## To do / More ideas ##
  * Door sensor on the letterbox. 
  * Add door sensor and lights for the attic.
  * Pause/restart robovac in the kitchen when motion detected.
